Well done!

It would be the correct answer if you had only manager_id in the select.
Another solution:
SELECT man.first_name, man.cast_name, COUNT(emp.employee_id) as cnt_of_emp
FROM employees man JOIN employees emp ON man.employee_id=emp.manager_id
GROUP BY man.first_name, man.cast_name
HAVING COUNT(emp.employee_id)>6

3. 
Why not to join without the subquery?

5.
Group by is not needed.
